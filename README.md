Pokemon!
This is a networked, 1v1 pokemon-like battle. Each player has 3 pokemon. Each round, each player will submit a move. Once all players have submitted a move, the server will then process the moves and broadcast the new pokemon HP's to all the clients. Rounds continue until a player's entire party has fainted.


HOW TO PLAY:
Within sec-1/sockets, there are two executables: run_client and run_server.

These will only work if you have built the project ONCE in Visual Studio. By default, the Visual Studio version will run the server.

Upon opening, you can explore your PC and the pokemon on your team. Once you are ready, select option 3 on the server to start the host (server+client).
You can then select option 3 on the client to connect to the host.

A UI will pop up with your pokemon and your opponent's Pokemon. Choose your abilities and fight your opponent until your pokemon fall!!
